### Hi, I'm Mallika ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product marketing leader focused on developer platforms, AI, and GTM strategy. I partner with product, engineering, and sales to drive adoption, build clarity, and scale messaging. Most of my work lives outside GitHub, but I'm here to explore the platform, contribute where I can, and better understand how developers work.
